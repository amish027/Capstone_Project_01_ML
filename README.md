# Capstone_Project_01_ML
Successfully completed the capstone project on Machine Learning algorithm.

### Project Overview
In this capstone project, a machine learning model was developed using the students.csv dataset. Libraries such as Pandas  and Sklearn  were utilized. Data was extracted from MySQL , preprocessed, and used to create a logistic regression model. The data was split into training and testing sets, achieving an accuracy of 89% ✅.

### Tools and Methodology

#### Tools
- **📊 Pandas:** For data manipulation and preprocessing, ensuring clean and structured datasets for analysis.
- **📚 Sklearn:** Used for building the logistic regression model and handling model training and testing.
- **💾 MySQL:** Extracted the students.csv dataset from a MySQL database for further analysis.
- **🖥️ Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive data analysis, visualization, and model development.

#### Methodology
- **🔍 Data Extraction:** Retrieved the students.csv dataset from MySQL for analysis.
- **🧹 Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values and standardizing features.
- **📈 Model Development:** Built a logistic regression model to predict student outcomes based on the dataset.
- **🧪 Model Evaluation:** Split data into training and testing sets, achieving an accuracy of 89% for validation.
